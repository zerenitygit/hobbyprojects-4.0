# Responsive Websites Are To Be Strived Towards For the Uttermost Ambitious Projects

Might add media queries for ALL my html files in the future.

# Not All Files Have Responsive Design Features (due to various differing design focuses of the files)

# NOTE:

Naming conventions of elements in the html and js files are not optimal, needs to be planned better.
Document structure of things in all files could be a lot better.
Some Links Work, Most Don't (this is intentionally done since I'm not creating all the pages for all the links)

# Current HTML problems

How images are to be scaled and setup is something I find difficulty in. I find difficulty in finding a way of allowing images to scale at the same time as wanting the images to
retain the same width and height as its other images.
A simple solution is to put width 100% for the scaling part for now, but when doing so I cant fix so that the images who have different original widths and heights get the same
width and height as some other images (let's say 500px). Looking to find a solution that allows me set an absolute get-go width and height for an imported image, but then allow
the image to scale down for different screen sizes.

Another "problem" is in section3 of "myfirstwebsitehome.html" with the alignment of content which now is asymmetrical due to more present text in Alter and Myrvas description making the aligment of content asymmetrical across the student profiles.
